# Quick Start

AWF can be used to create applications which can run standalone, as Joomla! components or as WordPress plugins. Since it is not obvious how you can get started with this kind of cross-platform, single-source applications we have compiled this quick start area.

Each quick start package gives you a proposed folder structure to get quickly started with each application type. It's worth noting that AWF applications running inside Joomla! and WordPress essentially consist of a native integration layer for the underlying CMS which wraps an otherwise standalone application.

Check the README.md file inside each quick start package for more information.
